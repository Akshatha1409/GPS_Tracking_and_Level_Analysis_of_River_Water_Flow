# GPS_Tracking_and_Level_Analysis_of_River_Water_Flow

Abstract 

Water resources management (WRM) is a key global challenge. This paper supports the creation of an application for the better analysis of the water resources in the country
without any faulty information misleading the records. This was thought so that the people can themselves know the situation of the water availability in their area and use water precisely. The Central Water Commission(CWC) can now keep a constant record of the water availability by itself without any intermediary.It is important for us to evaluate the water flow in different areas.
